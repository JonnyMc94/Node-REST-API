# Node-REST-API
A REST api written in vanilla Node.js without the use of frameworks i.e Express etc
This is to get to grips with writing API's with Node for an upcoming project. Moving on to Express after this so knowing how it works under the hood will help.

The API calls were tested using Postman.
